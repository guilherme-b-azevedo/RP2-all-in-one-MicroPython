def startStop(pin):
    """Called by and interruption handler triggered by the 'pin' passed as argument, this function initialize/deinitizalize a timer that recurrently calls the main function.
    
    A timer repeatedly calling the main function is a better solution than an infinite main loop, as the classic while loop that is always true for example. This is because through a timer, the serial communication through USB, including the python REPL remains available between calls to the main function, which does not happen when having an infinite loop, which prevents sending a reset signal for example. When there is a file named 'main.py', which automatically executes when the board is powered up, and it contains an infinite main loop, it is impossible to intentionally stop the loop execution to download a new software version, for example, it ends up being necessary to format the board. Using timer for recurring call, a command like Ctrl+C via REPL or through an IDE, stops the software and allow modifications and testing."""
